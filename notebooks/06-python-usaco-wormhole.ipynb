    "# Problem Description\n",
    "# The problem is to sort a list of wormholes based on their coordinates. Each wormhole has a unique x-coordinate and a y-coordinate. The sorting should be done in such a way that if a wormhole at index i has a partner wormhole at index j, then after sorting, the wormhole at index i should be paired with the wormhole at index j+1. If there is no partner wormhole for a wormhole, it should be paired with itself. The input consists of an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 12), the number of wormholes, followed by N pairs of integers representing the x and y coordinates of each wormhole. The output should be a single integer, the number of distinct pairings that can be formed after sorting the wormholes."
