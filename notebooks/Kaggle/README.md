## Python Syntax
Python uses a simple natural language syntax, incorporating many English words as key commands. Variables are used in Python to house various data types, typically named using lowercase lettering, with words separated by underscores. Variables and the data types they house are the main focus of a program, which intends to output a result. Functions can be applied to variables, which typically output a result based on the variable input. Various data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries and more can house large amounts of data with different uses and applications.

## Basic Python Data Types
Python utilizes a few basic data types within its syntax

Strings - Strings are pieces of texts denoted by single, double, or triple quotes.
    Properties: Length(number of characters), Format(upper/lower case), Immutability, No Character Restrictions
    Uses: Concatonation, Copying, Splicing, Formatting, Parameter, Data Structure Incorporation
    Functions: str(), len(), find(), count(), index(), join(), upper(), lower(), format()


Int - Integers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction p/q where q | p
    Properties: Value, Characters Limited To Numbers
    Uses: Arithmetic Operations, Iteration Type, Parameter, Comparisons, Data Structure Incorporation
    Functions: int(), abs(), floor(), ceil(), range(), imag()

Booleans - Booleans consist of two statements, either True or False
    Properties: Value(1 or 0), Answer To Question
    Uses: Logic Operations, Addition , Parameter, Comparisons
    Functions: bool()

## Basic Data Structures
Python uses data structures to organize large amounts of data and can be characterized
by their mutability and integration into larger programs.

Lists - Lists can be used to store any data type and are denoted by []
    Properties
