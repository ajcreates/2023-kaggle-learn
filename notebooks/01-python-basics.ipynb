    "Python uses a simple natural language syntax, incorporating many English words as key commands. Variables are used in Python to house various data types, typically named using lowercase lettering, with words separated by underscores. Variables and the data types they house are the main focus of a program, which intends to output a result. Functions can be applied to variables, which typically output a result based on the variable input. Various data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries and more can house large amounts of data with different uses and applications."
