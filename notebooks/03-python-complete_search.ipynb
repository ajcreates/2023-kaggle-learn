    "# Complete Search \n",
    "- USACO problems often require a \"brute force\" method called **complete search**, where a program iterates throughout an entire solution set, be it integers, combinations, or other objects. \n",
    "- In Python, for and while loops are often used to iterate through elements, however, this method can be time-consuming. \n",
    "- A technique called recursion is often used, in which certain data structures can be updated after each iteration of a loop, which compiles the results of a complete search within a single data structure, such as a list or dictionary."
