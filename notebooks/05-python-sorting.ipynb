    "# Sorting \n",
    "Sorting is an essential algorithmic skill when solving problems, it autmatically can reveal duplicate elements and simple iterations as well as simplifying complex arrays.\n",
    "Types of sorting include\n",
    "- Alphabetical: Sorting strings by their first letters prioritizing those earlier in the alphabet\n",
    "- Numerical: Sorting sets of numbers from 'least' to 'greatest'\n",
    "- Lexographical: Ordering permutations in a similar way that words can be organized alphabetically or numbers in increasing order but with more complex items like lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python already allows for the use of the built-in sorting commands **sort()** and **sorted()**, the first of which replaces the old list with a sorted one and the second of which returns a new sorted list. Both have a parameter called *key*, that allows for a specific sorting algorithm to be specified. It also allows for more complex sorting in its *operator* module, with its itemgetter(), attrgetter(), and methodcaller() commands.\n",
